# DroidNFC-Example
Really simple example on how to use the NFC framework of android using Xamarin, all magic is inside the MainActivity file.

1. Start App
1. Scan Tag
1. If tag has content and ID it will be shown
    1. ID As base64 string
    1. Content encoded with ASCII
1. If no content is avalible it will write one, scan again to see


Thats it :)
